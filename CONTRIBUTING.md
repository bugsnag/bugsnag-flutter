## Reporting issues

Are you having trouble getting started?
Please [contact us directly](mailto:support@bugsnag.com?subject=%5BGitHub%5D%20Flutter%20SDK%20-%20having%20trouble%20getting%20started%20with%20Bugsnag)
for assistance with integrating Bugsnag into your application. If you have spotted a problem with
this module, feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-flutter/issues/new).
Here are a few things to check before doing so:

* Are you using the latest version of `bugsnag-flutter`? If not, does updating to the latest version
  fix your issue?
* Has somebody
  else [already reported](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-flutter/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen)
  your issue? Feel free to add additional context to or check-in on an existing issue that matches
  your own.
* Is your issue caused by this module? Only things related to the `bugsnag-flutter` module should be
  reported here. For anything else, please [contact us directly](mailto:support@bugsnag.com) and
  we'd be happy to help you out.

### Fixing issues

If you've identified a fix to a new or existing issue, we welcome contributions!
Here are some helpful suggestions on contributing that help us merge your PR quickly and smoothly:

* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the
  [library on GitHub](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-flutter)
* Build and test your changes using the example app and test suite
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* [Make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
* Ensure the automated checks pass (and if it fails, please try to address the cause)

### Adding features

Unfortunately we’re unable to accept PRs that add features or refactor the library at this time.
However, we’re very eager and welcome to hearing feedback about the library so please contact us
directly to discuss your idea, or open a
[feature request](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-flutter/issues/new?template=Feature_request.md)
to help us improve the library.

Here’s a bit about our process designing and building the Bugsnag libraries:

* We have an internal roadmap to plan out the features we build, and sometimes we will already be
  planning your suggested feature!
* Our open source libraries span many languages and frameworks so we strive to ensure they are
  idiomatic on the given platform, but also consistent in terminology between platforms. That way
  the core concepts are familiar whether you adopt Bugsnag for one platform or many.
* Finally, one of our goals is to ensure our libraries work reliably, even in crashy, multi-threaded
  environments. Oftentimes, this requires an intensive engineering design and code review process
  that adheres to our style and linting guidelines.
